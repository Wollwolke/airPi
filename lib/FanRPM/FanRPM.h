 * @brief Stores measurements and computes fan speed.
 *
 * This class measures rotations per minute of a fan reporting its speed
 * by sending a signal once per rotation (by default; other signal frequencies
 * are possible, see multiplier()). The signal is captured from a pin
 * using an associated interrupt. Interrupt's handling routine must call
 * interrupt() routine.
 *
 * To read the measurement, call get_speed() routine.
 *
 * You can dump the internal state to serial console using dump() method,
 * but this method is not synchronized (i.e., it may report erratic data).

   * The multiplier is used to compute real RPM of the fan. There are fans,
   * which do not send one tacho signal per rotation, but rather 2 or 3 or 4.
   * Setting the multiplier to proper value will correct the measurement.
   *
   * The multiplier is set in units of 1/RPM_MULTIPLIER_BASE. I.e., the value
   * RPM_MULTIPLIER_BASE means identity, or 1:1 speed. Multiplier of RPM_MULTIPLIER_BASE/2
   * would mean 1/2, i.e., when the fan sends 2 signals per rotation, use this multiplier.
   *
   * The change of the multiplier takes effect immediately.
